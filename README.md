Horiseon project

Horiseon is a marketing website that with a code that needed to be cleaned up a bit and made a little more user friendly. I was able to change some of the nonsemantic elements to semantic elements in html. I added alt attributes to images so that someone who has vision disability will be able to see what the pictures are of. I also cleaned up the code and combined classes that had the same attributes , and turned the code from wet to dry. This way the code is a lot easier and efficient to read for a developer.
